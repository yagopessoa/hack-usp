A prototype project created during the [HackathonUSP 2018.2](https://hackathon.ime.usp.br/2018.2). The idea is a system to list all the research labs of the University, so the companies can see what researches are been made and contact the lab and possibly start a partnership, where the company finances the research and in return the lab applies the result on the company business.
